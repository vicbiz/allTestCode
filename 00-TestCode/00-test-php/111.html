        Dear Jae: Thank you for being a loyal and trusted employee. As you know,
        the ongoing COVID-19 emergency has had a negative impact on business for
        Forbes Travel Guide (the “Company”). These conditions require the
        Company to take a number of difficult, but hopefully temporary,
        measures. This letter is to inform you that, due to the COVID-19
        emergency and related business interruptions, you are being temporarily
        furloughed without pay from the close of business on Friday, September
        18, 2020 to the open of business on Monday, January 4, 2021. Although we
        anticipate we will reinstate you to work beginning on Monday, January 4,
        2021, during and after the furlough period, the Company will evaluate
        whether the furlough will end or continue. We will then notify you
        regarding next steps. Please do not perform any work or return to work
        during the furlough period until directed to do so by the Company.
      </div>

        <div>
          1. What is a temporary furlough? This temporary furlough is a
          Company-initiated leave of absence due to the lack of business and
          government shutdowns related to the novel coronavirus. This action is
          an operational necessity; it is not a reflection on your work
          performance. During the furlough, you are still a Company employee
          unless told otherwise by the Company. You will use any available
          accrued paid time off prior to taking unpaid leave. After PTO is
          exhausted, your leave of absence will be unpaid, except to the extent
          that government benefits apply.
        </div>
        <div>
          2. Do I remain on group benefits? While furloughed (i.e., on a leave
          of absence), you are permitted to remain on group benefits so long as
          you are currently on benefits and remain eligible under the applicable
          Plan documents. During the furlough period, the Company will pay the
          employee-paid portion of the group benefits premiums and will continue
          to pay the employer portion of your benefits premiums while the
          furlough continues.
        </div>
        <div>
          3. Am I entitled to Unemployment Insurance Benefits? During the
          furlough period, you may file for Unemployment Insurance Benefits from
          the State subject to state-law requirements. Unemployment Insurance
          Benefits are intended to provide temporary financial assistance to
          individuals who are not working through no fault of their own.
          However, you may not be entitled to Unemployment Insurance Benefits if
          you are using PTO. Please visit the Unemployment Insurance Benefits
          website for your State for the most up-to-date information regarding:
          <br />
          (1) eligibility, <br />
          (2) how to apply, <br />
          (3) when and how benefits will be made available during the COVID-19
          emergency, and <br />
          (4) the weekly dollar amount you may be eligible to receive. The
          decision to grant or deny a petition for Unemployment Insurance
          Benefits is made by the State, not the Company. <br /><br />

          The website for your State is:
          <a href="https://dol.georgia.gov/">https://dol.georgia.gov/</a> . In
          addition, the government may provide other benefits (such as paid
          family leave or temporary disability benefits) to workers who are
          temporarily unable to work for other reasons, such as parental leave,
          government-required quarantine, a serious medical condition, or the
          need to care for a seriously ill family member. Please refer to
          official government websites for information regarding all potential
          government-sponsored benefits that may be available to you.

          4. How long will the furlough period last? As stated above, the
          furlough period will be to the open of business on Monday, January 4,
          2021. Although we anticipate we will reinstate you to work beginning
          on Monday, January 4, 2021, during and after the furlough period, the
          Company will evaluate whether the furlough will end or continue. We
          will then notify you regarding next steps. <br /><br />
          We will communicate updates to you primarily via text message and
          personal email. Please check your personal email daily and ensure the
          Company has your most updated contact information. <br /><br />
          Upon communication to you that the furlough is ending, you will be
          expected to promptly return to work as scheduled by the Company.
          Please note that your employment remains at-will. This is a rapidly
          changing situation and the furlough period stated in this letter may
          be changed or terminated at the sole discretion of the Company. This
          letter does not create an employment contract. <br /><br />
          We understand and appreciate the difficulty and anxiety this situation
          creates, and we anticipate returning you to work as soon as possible.
          Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not
          hesitate to contact your manager. Thank you for your continued service
          to the Company.
