Creating an App

You¡¯ll need to have Node >= 6 on your local development machine (but it¡¯s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to easily switch Node versions between different projects.
To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

npx
	npx create-react-app my-app
	(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

npm
	npm init react-app my-app
	npm init <initializer> is available in npm 6+

Yarn
	yarn create react-app my-app
